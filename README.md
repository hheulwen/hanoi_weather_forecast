# A Multivariate ML-DL Approach for Weather Time Series Forecasting
## Overview
Forecasting future values of a time series plays a crucial role in various fields such as economics, finance, business intelligence, and industrial applications. Real-world scenarios like speech recognition, real-time sign language translation, financial markets, and weather forecasting also rely on accurate time series predictions.

Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are known to perform best when a massive dataset is available for learning. However, not every time series problem benefits from such large datasets. In cases where data is limited or of medium size, advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can provide competitive performance.

Due to the nature of time series analysis—where the same feature at different time steps is treated as separate features—the effective data size increases. This makes it challenging to determine the most suitable algorithm for a medium-sized dataset.

This project aims to recommend and compare the best ML/DL algorithms for medium-sized time series datasets, providing insights into their performance and usability.
